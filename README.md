 At MyCash, I was a Trainee previously where I developed an experience of working in the professional world along with excellent guidance from programming team. This gave me a relative experience in watching real-life business software development at the time when I have no idea what happens behind closed doors. How all stages of the project are supposed to be done, starting from prerequisites at conceptual level ending on production and testing. The team taught me all the ins and outs of what makes a strong code base, an accessible user experience and how to leverage agile methodologies in producing robust, useable applications for public consumption.
# Calculator
 Apart from this, I also worked on a calculator project all alone working in Android Studio; This was developed using Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and the application gave me good exposure to build up tech skills. This was the hands-on project which enlightened me with how powerful Kotlin is, as well exposed to building user interfaces featuring Jetpack Compose. Using these tools taught me the importance of writing high-quality and easily maintainable code that also facilitated a good user experience. Working alongside MyCash and the technical skills that I have harnessed from independent projects have made me ready to take on more significant roles within software development, in which way I can further develop and contribute
