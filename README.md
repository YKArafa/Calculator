 At MyCash, I was a Trainee previously where I developed an experience of working in the professional world along with excellent guidance from programming team. This gave me a relative experience in watching real-life business software development at the time when I have no idea what happens behind closed doors. How all stages of the project are supposed to be done, starting from prerequisites at conceptual level ending on production and testing. The team taught me all the ins and outs of what makes a strong code base, an accessible user experience and how to leverage agile methodologies in producing robust, useable applications for public consumption.
# Kotlin experience
I took the initiative to learn Kotlin from scratch and practiced my skills on Codeforces, where I engaged in solving a wide range of coding challenges. This rigorous practice helped me sharpen my problem-solving abilities, improve my coding efficiency, and integrate Kotlin seamlessly into my toolkit. Over time, I gained confidence in using Kotlin to develop clean and effective code, further solidifying it as a core part of my skill set.

# JetPack Compose
I learned Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs, that allowed me to create sleek and responsive interfaces with ease. Its declarative style made it simpler to write clean, efficient code while handling layouts effortlessly. Working with Jetpack Compose not only sharpened my ability to design user-friendly apps but also deepened my understanding of the latest trends in Android development.
# Fruits of Labor 
I applied all these skills to develop a calculator application using Android Studio. By leveraging Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, I crafted a sleek, user-friendly interface and implemented efficient, responsive functionality. This project allowed me to put my knowledge into practice, resulting in a practical and polished app that showcased my ability to combine modern development techniques and create a high-quality user experience.
