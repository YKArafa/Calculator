 During my time as a trainee at MyCash, I gained invaluable experience working in a professional environment under the guidance of a skilled programming team. This experience allowed me to observe and learn the intricacies of software development in a real-world business setting. I gained a deeper understanding of the entire development process, from initial concept and design to implementation and testing. The team's insights and guidance were instrumental in helping me grasp the importance of effective coding practices, user-centric design, and agile methodologies, which are essential for creating high-quality, practical applications for public use.
# Calculator
 In addition to this, I independently worked on a calculator project using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose in Android Studio, which allowed me to apply and enhance my technical skills. This project provided a hands-on opportunity to explore the power of Kotlin and the modern capabilities of Jetpack Compose for building intuitive and responsive user interfaces. Working with these tools helped me understand the significance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code while focusing on delivering a seamless user experience. My experience at MyCash, coupled with the technical knowledge I gained through independent projects, has prepared me to take on more challenging roles in software development, where I can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully.
